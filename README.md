### `DESCRIPTION`

The Flashcard Generator is a frontend capstone project that allows users to create, edit, and share flashcards in groups. The app is built using React, Tailwind CSS, Redux, and other technologies, and is fully responsive.

### `FUNCTIONALITY`

### `CREATE NEW`

The "Create New" page, where users can create new flashcard groups.

### `MY FLASHCARDS`

The "My Flashcard" page, where users can view all created groups, along with their headings, icons, descriptions, and number of cards.

### `FLASHCARD DETAILS`

The "Flashcard Details" page, where users can view and navigate individual cards, as well as share, print, and download them.

### `npm start`

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`
